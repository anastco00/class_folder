   <h1>GAGAUZ YERI </h1> 
   <p class="first"> Üülen Bessarabiyada yerleşer hem Bucak topraan büük bir kısmını içersinä alêr. XVIII-XIX asirlerda gagauz halkının büük payı toplu olarak, Balkannardan geläräk, Rusiya İmperiyasının Osmannı İmperiyasınnan kazandıı Bucak topraana saabilendi hem bölä peydalandı Gagauz Yeri. <br> <br> Gagauzia is an autonomous territorial unit of Moldova. Its autonomy is ethnically motivated by the predominance in the region of the Gagauz people, who are primarily Orthodox Turkic-speaking people.[4][5]

    At the end of World War I, all of the territory of Gagauzia became part of the Kingdom of Romania, before being carved up into the Soviet Union in June 1940. From 1941 to 1944 it was again part of Romania, after which it was incorporated into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. As the Soviet Union began to disintegrate, Gagauzia declared independence in 1990 as the Gagauz Republic, but was integrated into Moldova in 1994. </p>

            <p class="second"> Wine in Gagauz culture plays an important role. It is both a tool for communication, a ‘folk cure’ for all diseases, and simply a factor of good mood. Gagauzia is famous for its amazing climate that is ideal for growing grapes. Powerful solar activity and gentle terrain contribute to harvesting of the grape varieties perfect for wine-making and making Gagauzia abundant with wine. It is produced by both large wineries leftover from the Soviet Union, and new ones. Gagauz people commonly make wine from the grapes they grow in their own vineyards. Wine is the drink that unites people.</p>

              <p class="third"> If you dig into the history of the Gagauzian carpet, it becomes clear that there is no clear date when exactly it appeared. According to Andrei Ivarlac, they emerged at the beginning of the 18th century, when the Gagauz started migrating from Bulgaria to the Bugeac steppe. The carpet became self-sufficient and recognizably Gagauzian as the living conditions of the Gagauz changed, and many elements of household items and nature were transposed into the art of carpets. However, we can find an exact date for the disappearance of the Gagauzian carpet. It happened in 1946, after the war, when famine was rampant and people had to survive.  That year, many people sold everything they had, including carpets. Only a few preserved their traditional Gagauzian carpets at home.If you dig into the history of the Gagauzian carpet, it becomes clear that there is no clear date when exactly it appeared.

              <p class="third">The traditional clothing of Gagauzians is related with the national costume of Balkan area. Today Gagauz people use ordinary western-style clothes for every day. But on national holidays, ceremonies and celebrations they often use the traditional attire. Though older people still wear pieces of national costume in day-to-day life.

                The national Gagauz men's costume consists of a shirt, cloth trousers, a wide belt and a hat. The belt is called "kushak", it should be red. It is an obligatory element. The belt should be wrapped around the waist as many times as the age of the man is (if he is 15, the belt is wrapped around 15 times). In winter Gagauz men traditionally wear a shirt, trousers made from sheepskin (with fur turned in), a sleeveless fur coat, a short sheepskin jacket and a fur cap (Karakul sheep hat). Such garment is typical for shepherds, and that's one of the main crafts of Gagauzians.

                The national Gagauz women's costume consists of a canvas shirt, a sleeveless dress, an apron, a smock, and a large black kerchief. In winter they use a dress with sleeves, a jacket, and a sleeveless fur coat.
                
                The kerchief which is obligatory for women of all ages is often decorated with coins. </p>

            <p class="fourth">The character of the “nomadic” people is very well emphasized in the Gagauz dance.

              “The Gagauz (character) is a warrior, this is Oguz, this is the one who was attacked and who attacked. This is emphasized. There are a lot of sharp movements in Gagauz dances - so the guys, as it were, are defending their right to exist. Have you seen how the girls walk smoothly? Like fallow deer, they emphasize this, as if playing: they pick flowers, fruits, ”Germek said. 
              
              Everything is important in the dance: the look, the expressive turns of the head, the smooth movements of the arms and the clear movements of the legs. </p>
